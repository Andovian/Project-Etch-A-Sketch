# Project-Etch-A-Sketch
Odin Project: Etch-A-Sketch

Created an initital Etch-a-Sketch canvas that is 16x16 squares.

Clicking the "Change Size" button prompts the user to enter a number that will create a new Etch-a-Sketch canvas with the users new value (num x num).

// Still need to get the canvas to stay the same size everytime a new value is entered.
Update: Set the grid container size to 940px by 940px. Setting the grid container size will allow grid-template-columns to auto fill the available space evenly. Spent way too long to figure this out. -__-

Also added a reset button to the bottom of the page.

What I learned:

1. Learned some CSS grid concepts but still need a lot more practice.
2. Learned how to use a for loop to create elements and append them to the DOM
3. Learned how to use event listeners, primarily 'mouseenter'
